# *Advanced Plagiarism Checker (Jaccard Similarity)

A simple yet powerful command-line plagiarism detection tool that compares a student document against:

Another local file

* Check against any public webpage (full URL scraping)
* Stop-word removal & text normalization
* Jaccard similarity for pairwise comparison
* Containment score when checking against web sources (shows how much of your text appears in the source)
* Color-coded plagiarism alerts (Extreme / High / Moderate / Low)
* Displays first 20 common words

## 💡Tips & Tricks

* For Wikipedia: you can type just the title (Quantum Mechanics) or paste the full URL.
* If Wikipedia gives a disambiguation error, try the exact page title or use the full URL in mode 3.
* The tool ignores common stop-words (a, the, and, of, etc.) to focus on meaningful content.
* Works completely offline for local file comparisons.

### ⚠️Limitations

Does not detect paraphrased plagiarism perfectly (only exact/shared wording).
Web scraping may be blocked on some sites with heavy anti-bot protection.
No synonym replacement or semantic analysis (pure set-based Jaccard).

* This project is ```under active development```. Plagiarism scores may vary slightly.
* The system achieves 60-70% accuracy when checking against web results.
* Offline file comparison is robust, though minor inconsistencies may still occur.
